When I was graduating from a technical course a few years ago, I heard a speech that I didn't know at the time, but entered in my mind as if someone was planting a seed in the earth. The speech was about growth and, especially, about taking advantage of the opportunities that were so close to continuing seeking knowledge and, who knows, becoming a Ph.D. Although the opportunity was indeed physically close, it seemed a distant reality. But life is somewhat curious, and, to make things short, I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computational Modeling at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing. My research is related to the reproducibility of computational experiments and I'll soon explain about it in a post here.
